Pickling is all about data serialization and converting Python objects into byte streams to be saved to disk or transferred over a network. "Un-pickling" or opening the files back up is, as expected, the inverse of that - building the byte streams back into the Python objects they started as. 

In the Notebook here, we will see the basic process to utilizing the Pickle library and pickling process in Python to save to disk, write, open and close while also discussing the tradition of the Christmas Pickle!

This is just a very basic introduction, but I suspect there will be a follow up to this very soon with Machine Learning on the horizon! 

For more detail and information on the Christmas Pickle, please take a look at the blog post that can be found [here](https://medium.com/@smashley-eakland).
